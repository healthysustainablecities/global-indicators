The GHSCI tool can be used to configure study regions, conduct analysis, generate resources and compare results in four ways, depending on preference:

## Web app
- To launch the app in your web browser, type `ghsci` and open the displayed URL in your web browser

## Jupyter Lab
- To use a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Lab Notebook, type `lab`, open the displayed URL in your web browser and double click to select the example notebook `example.ipynb` from the left-hand side browser pane

## Command line
- The basic shortcut commands `configure`, `analysis`, `generate` and `compare` can be run at the command line in conjunction with a codename referring to your study region

## Python
- Optionally, the process can be run in Python, for example:

```{python}
import ghsci
# set a codename for your city; here is the codename for the provided example
codename = 'example_ES_Las_Palmas_2023'

# Initialise configuration file for your region
r = ghsci.Region(codename)

# Now, you need to source and download data, documenting metadata and file paths in the configuration file generated in the process/configuration/regions directory
# Once that is completed, you can proceed:
r.analysis()
r.generate()

# if you've analysed and generated results for other study regions, you can compare the main results
r.compare('another_previously_processed_codename')

# if for some reason you want to drop the database for your study region to start again:
r.drop()

# You will be asked if you really want to do this!  It requires entering "ghscic" to confirm
# This doesn't remove any generated files or folders - you'll have to remove those yourself, if you want to.
```
