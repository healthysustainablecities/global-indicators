# 5. Detailed Setup

Additional general information on configuration, analysis, reporting and comparison steps using the GHSCI software is provided below, including guidance on [what to do if you get stuck](./#What-if-I-get-stuck).

## Study regions
Before commencing analysis, your study regions will need to be configured with details of your downloaded data, the metadata used to document this data, and parameters to guide the software's usage of this data in analyses.

The configuration files are text files using the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) (.yml) format.  They can be opened and modified using a text editor to define region-specific details, including which datasets are being used, where they were sourced from, and how they should be interpreted.  Region configuration files are located within the `configuration/regions` sub-folder. An example region configuration for Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (for which data supporting analysis is included) has been provided in the file `process/configuration/regions/example_ES_Las_Palmas_2023.yml`.  This can also be viewed online [here](https://github.com/healthysustainablecities/global-indicators/blob/main/process/configuration/regions/example_ES_Las_Palmas_2023.yml).  At the top of the configuration file are some instructions that describe how to understand and modify the file.

New regions can be added by using the `configuration` utility functions described elsewhere that initialise a new region configuration file using a city [codename](./#Codenames) at `process/configuration/regions/_codename_.yml`.  This file can be edited using a text editor, or within [Jupyter Lab](./#Jupyter-Lab).

## Study region configuration template v5.0.0 (3 Apri 2024)

## This configuration file uses the YAML format (https://yaml.org/) to describe the data sources, parameters and metadata used to analyse and generate urban indicator resources using the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators software (https://global-healthy-liveable-cities.github.io/).

## Text beginning with a double hash symbol ("##") is are comments (used to provide descriptions of how to complete the item immediately below).  Text beginning with a single has symbol ("#") are commented out section of code that may optionally be uncommented as per the provided instructions.

## Optional sections that contain parameters which may be uncommented are marked with a series of hash symbols ("###########") at their start and end lines.

## If entering or modifying a parameter
## - leave a space after the semi-colon
## - indents (ie. 4 spaces) signify a nested sub-list of configurable parameters

## It is recommended to view or edit this file in an application providing syntax highlighting, for example, the provided Jupyter Lab web app:
## - type 'lab' at the GHSCI prompt
## - navigate to the "process/configuration/region/" folder in the browser pane
## - double click on the YAML configuration file with the name ending in .yml you wish to edit

This has been done because the point indicators were sampled along the pedestrian network and are therefore unlikely to intersect with buildings.  By taking the average of points within some reasonable distance, the result is like a moving window average that should provide a reasonable representation of the immediate neighbourhood milieu surrounding the building."

## Network analysis related configuration parameters
network:
    #########
    ## Optional network parameters for use in some contexts (eg. island cities)
    ## Whether to only retain the main connected network when retrieving OSM roads (set to "false"; the default, which is appropriate for most settings); or retain network 'islands' if present ("true")
    # osmnx_retain_all: false
    ## Whether to extract the network for the buffered study region. It is recommended to set to 'true' (the default) in most cases.  Setting this to false may be appropriate for true islands, but could be problematic for anywhere else where the network and associated amenities may be accessible beyond the edge of the study region boundary).
    # buffered_region: true
    ## Iterate over and combine polygons (this may be appropriate for a series of islands, like Hong Kong), but in most cases it is recommended to be set as false
    # polygon_iteration: false
    ## Minimum total network distance for subgraphs to retain.  This is a useful parameter for customising analysis for islands, like Hong Kong, but for most purposes, you can leave this blank (the default).
    # connection_threshold:
    #########
    ## Tolerance in metres for cleaning intersections.  If not providing your own data for evaluating intersection density (see below), this is an important methodological choice.  The chosen parameter should be robust to a variety of network topologies in the city being studied.  See https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/main/notebooks/04-simplify-graph-consolidate-nodes.ipynb. For example, 12

        ## citation for optional custom intersection data
        # citation: 'Provider of your intersection data.  YYYY.  Name of your intersection data. https://source-url-for-your-data.place'
        ## a note to describe custom intersection data
        # note: 'Uncomment this configuration section to optionally specify an external dataset of intersections.  Otherwise, these are derived using OpenStreetMap and OSMnx using the intersection_tolerance parameter.  If providing intersection data, you can modify this note for it to be included in the metadata, or remove it.

## Network analysis related configuration parameters
network:
    #########
    ## Optional network parameters for use in some contexts (eg. island cities)
    ## Whether to only retain main connected network when retrieving OSM roads (set to "false"; the default, which is appropriate for most settings); or retain network 'islands' if present ("true")
    # osmnx_retain_all: false
    ## Whether to extract the network for the buffered study region. It is recommended to set to 'true' (the default) in most cases.  Setting this to false may be appropriate for true islands, but could be problematic for anywhere else where the network and associated amenities may be accessible beyond the edge of the study region boundary).
    # buffered_region: true
    ## Iterate over and combine polygons (this may be appropriate for a series of islands, like Hong Kong), but in most cases it is recommended to be set as false
    # polygon_iteration: false
    ## Minimum total network distance for subgraphs to retain.  This is a useful parameter for customising analysis for islands, like Hong Kong, but for most purposes you can leave this blank (the default).
    # connection_threshold:
    #########
    ## Tolerance in metres for cleaning intersections.  If not providing your own data for evaluating intersection density (see below), this is an important methodological choice.  The chosen parameter should be robust to a variety of network topologies in the city being studied.  See https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/main/notebooks/04-simplify-graph-consolidate-nodes.ipynb. For example, 12
    intersection_tolerance: 12

    ## Optionally, exceptions to the template can be specified here, this can be useful for additional translation customisation without modifying the report_configuration.xlsx file.  These phrases can incorporate translated phrases defined in report configuration, by enclosing these in curly braces, e.g. like {this}, if 'this' has been defined as a phrase in the relevant language.  See the example region for a demonstration of how this can be used.  Sections from the example can be pasted here and modified as required, or the below example can be uncommented.
    exceptions:

## Codenames
Region configuration files are named using a codename to represent a city when used in processing, for example `example_ES_Las_Palmas_2023`.  This helps to avoid issues with ambiguity when analysing multiple cities across different regions and time points (e.g. cities named Valencia are found in both Spain and Venezuala). In the case of our example city, we have used 'example' to provide a clarification about the study region's purpose, 'ES' clarifies that this is a Spanish city, 'Las_Palmas' is a common short way of writing the city's name, and the analysis is designed to target 2023, using data sources that could be reasonably assumed to provide a fair representation for the city at that time point. 

## Initialising

To initialise a new study region configuration file, you can run use the [Web app]() study region form, [Jupyter Lab](./#Jupyter-Lab) or Python (see example below), or command line (`configure <codename>`; Figure 17).  Running the configuration step for a study region with a previously initialised configuration file (e.g. `configure example_ES_Las_Palmas_2023`) would advise that the study region configuration has already been initialised, and provide guidance on how to run analyses once configuration has been completed by the user using a text editor.

*Figure 17. Output resulting from creating the configuration files; if you were to run this a second time after successfully running it, it would recognise and report that the files already exist, and otherwise remind you about the purpose of the respective configuration files.*

Alternatively, you can initialise a configuration file using Python (including using a Jupyter notebook), for example for the Australian city of Melbourne with a target time point of 2023:
```
from subprocesses import ghsci
r = ghsci.Region('AU_Melbourne_2023')
```

Once initialised, study region configuration files must then be modified using a text editor to provide information on the locations of downloaded data and analysis parameters as required.   

*A good way to view and edit the configuration files is using the provided [Jupyter Lab](./#Jupyter-Lab) interface.*

*Other than initialising a new study region (as described above), you can also copy the provided example to a new file and modify the values as required; this might be the easiest way to get started with your new region!*

## Advanced options

Additional configuration files will be initialised in the `process/configuration` folder, and may be be edited in a text editor (or in a spreadsheet editor such as Excel for the CSV file) to add and customise analysis for new regions, including

- `config.yml` for overall project configuration, including the names of you, your colleagues and organsisation for inclusion in generated metadata and reports
- `datasets.yml` to optionally define shared datasets and metadata for OpenStreetMap, population, urban regions and transit feeds that can be referenced by multiple study regions

Optionally, projects can be configured to:

- analyse [GTFS feed data](https://database.mobilitydata.org/) for evaluating accessibility to regularly serviced public transport
- use custom sets of OpenStreetMap tags for identifying destinations (see [OpenStreetMap TagInfo](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) and region-specific tagging guidelines to inform relevant synonyms for points of interest)
- use custom destination data (a path to CSV with coordinates for points of interest for different destination categories can be configured in `process/configuration/regions/_codename_.yml`)
