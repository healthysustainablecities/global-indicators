# 2  Spatial indicators and reporting software


## Usage in brief

The Global Healthy and Sustainable Cities Indicators (GHSCI) tool can be run in a web browser or as Python code (e.g. in Jupyter Lab).  Once the software environment has been retrieved and is running, analysis for a particular city proceeds in four steps:


1. Install the [Software](./2.-Spatial-indicators-and-reporting-software#software-set-up)
2. [Run the Example](./4.-Analysis-&-Generate-Resources#running-an-example)
3. [Configure](./4.-Analysis-&-Generate-Resources#configuration) study regions 
4. Perform region [Analysis](./4.-Analysis-&-Generate-Resources#analysis) 
5. [Generate](./4.-Analysis-&-Generate-Resources#generate) resources
6. [Compare](./4.-Analysis-&-Generate-Resources#compare) results (e.g. impact of hypothetical scenarios and sensitivity analysis, benchmarking between cities or regions of interest, monitoring change across time)

A fully configured example study region is provided along with data for users to familiarise themselves with the workflow and the possibilities of the generated resources.  The instructions below will describe how to perform the analysis, and how to access, run and modify the provided example Jupyter notebook to perform analyses for your own study regions.

## Software set up

1. Download  the [GHSCI software](https://github.com/healthysustainablecities/global-indicators/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) 
2. Unzip the folder and save it to a desired project folder directory on your computer
3. Install and run [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) according to the guidelines for your operating system of choice.  Our software is an official Docker Sponsored Open Source software project.     
_Make sure you have the latest version of Docker installed on your computer_           

4. Run the GHSCI software by opening the project folder where you extracted the software using a command line interface (e.g.  [Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) on Windows, [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) on MacOS, or [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) on Linux):
  - on Windows open the folder in Terminal or cmd.exe and enter `.\global-indicators.bat`
  - on MacOS/Linux in bash, enter `bash ./global-indicators.sh`
    - Linux users may need to prefix this with 'sudo' for elevated permissions when launching Docker containers (read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall))

This will retrieve the computational environment and launch the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators (GHSCI) software, along with a PostGIS spatial database that is used for processing and data management.  Once launched, instructions will be displayed (Figure 2).

*Figure 2. With Docker Desktop installed and running, run the global-indicators command to initialise the software environment and view usage instructions*

**In the next step**,   
* to launch the GHSCI app in your web browser, enter `ghsci`,    
* to launch Jupyter Lab in your browser, enter `lab`,    
* for command line or Python directions, enter `help`.
