# Indicators


Public policies are essential for supporting the design and creation of healthy and sustainable cities and neighbourhoods. The Global Observatory of Healthy and Sustainable Cities 1000 Cities Challenge Urban Policy Checklist assesses the presence and quality of recommended policies for your city. The checklist can then be used to generate a city scorecard and report, which summarise policy indicators for your city, and are designed to be tools to assist in advocating for change.

The 1000 Cities Challenge policy indicators are used to evaluate whether policies are: 
- **aligned** with the principles of healthy and sustainable cities, 
- **mandatory**/legally required to be adhered 
- accompanied by a **measurable** target, standard or threshold
  - and if so, whether this is informed by established standards and research evidence

The policy checklist was adapted from a study of 25 diverse cities published in The Lancet Global Health Series on Urban Design, Transport and Planning:

## INTEGRATED CITY PLANNING FOR HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
Many sectors are involved in creating healthy and sustainable cities, including land use, transport, housing, parks, economic development, and infrastructure. Integrated planning is required to ensure policy alignment across sectors. Health considerations need to be embedded in transport and urban policies, and investment in active and public transport should be prioritised.

### Transport and planning combined in one government department

### Transport policy with health-focused actions

### Urban policy with health-focused actions

### Health Impact Assessment requirements in urban/transport policy or legislation

### Urban and/or transport policy explicitly aims for integrated city planning

### Publicly available information on government expenditure for different transport modes

## WALKABILITY AND DESTINATION ACCESS POLICIES
Walkable neighbourhoods provide opportunities for active, healthy, and sustainable lifestyles through having sufficient but not excessive population density to support adequate provision of local amenities, including public transport services. They also have mixed land uses and well-connected streets, to ensure proximate and convenient access to destinations. High-quality pedestrian and cycling infrastructure and reducing traffic through managing demand for car use can also encourage active transport.

### Walking participation

### Cycling participation

### Pedestrian infrastructure

### Cycling infrastructure 

### Traffic safety

### Parking restrictions to discourage car use

### Street connectivity

### Housing or population density

### Residential building heights

### Limits on greenfield housing development

### Mixture of housing types/sizes

### Mixture of local destinations for daily living

### Close distance to daily living destinations

### Healthy food environments

### Crime prevention through environmental design

### Employment distribution requirements

### Ratio of jobs to housing

## PUBLIC TRANSPORT POLICIES
Easy access to frequent public transport is a key determinant of healthy and sustainable transport systems. Public transport near housing and employment increases the mode share of public transport trips, thus encouraging transport-related walking; offering access to regional jobs and services; improving health, economic development, and social inclusiveness; and reducing pollution and carbon emissions. The frequency of services also encourages public transport use, in addition to the proximity of stations or stops.

### Access to employment and services via public transport

### Public transport access

### Public transport use

## PUBLIC OPEN SPACE POLICIES
Local access to high-quality public open space promotes recreational physical activity and mental health. Nearby public open space creates convivial, attractive environments, helps cool the city and protects biodiversity. As cities densify and private open space declines, providing more public open space is critical for population health. Having public open space within 400-800 m of homes can encourage walking. Access to larger parks may also be important.

### Public open space access

## NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS POLICIES
Nature-based solutions, including urban greening and urban biodiversity protection, have mental health benefits by increasing contact with nature. Green spaces and vegetation cover can cool cities and help build resilience to extreme heat.

### Tree canopy and urban greening

### Urban biodiversity protection & promotion

## URBAN AIR QUALITY POLICIES
Land use and transport policies play a key role in limiting air pollution, with multiple benefits for health and sustainability.

### Transport policies to limit air pollution

### Land use policies to reduce air pollution exposure 

## CLIMATE DISASTER RISK REDUCTION POLICIES
In the face of climate change, built environments need to be designed to reduce the health impacts of increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events, such as heat waves, flooding, bushfires/wildfires and extreme storms.	

### Adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies


The following spatial indicators are intended to measure the provision and distribution of infrastructure supporting healthy and sustinable cities that can be calculated using open or custom data at global scale.  

They are based on a series of indicators calculated for 25 diverse cities in The Lancet Global Health Series on Urban Design, Transport and Planning:

## Density
### Population density per km² 

### Street intersection density per km² 

### Neighbourhood population density
Population density within a 1km walkable neighbourhood

### Neighbourhood intersection density
Street intersection density within a 1km walkable neighbourhood

## Access to amenities and services

### Access within 500 m to a range of amenities and services
A...
- fresh food market or supermarket 
- convenience store 
- any public open space 
- public open space larger than 1.5 hectares 
- public transport stop or station
- public transport with average daytime weekday service frequency of 20 minutes or better 

### Access to daily living amenities score 
Score of access to fresh food market, convenience and public transport within 500m using an active transport routable street network (/3)

## Walkability
### Walkability index
A sum of standardised scores for neighbourhood population density, street intersection density, and access to amenities.  This is a relative score that can be calculated for within-city comparisons, or using external reference standards (for example, the median results for the GOHSC 25-city study)
