# Validation process:

### 1. Data:
   
   Download OSM gpkg file from : https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/j1UababLcIw8vbM
   
   Download official dataset 
   
### 2. Change these names into the correct filenames and POIs of interest in POIs_validation.py
   
   official_filename = "Restaurant_and_Food_Related.shp"
   
   OSM_filename = "belfast_gb_2019_1600m_buffer.gpkg"
   
   POIs_name = "fresh_food_market"

### 3. Run the POIs_validation.py file
