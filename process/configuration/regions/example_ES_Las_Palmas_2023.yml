## analyse and generate urban indicator resources using the Global
## Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators software
## (https://global-healthy-liveable-cities.github.io/).
##
## Text beginning with a double hash symbol ("##") are comments
## (used to provide descriptions of how to complete the item
## immediately below). Text beginning with a single hash symbol
## ("#") are commented out sections of code that may optionally be
## uncommented as per the provided instructions.
##
## Optional sections that contain parameters which may be
## uncommented are marked with a series of hash symbols ("###########")
## at their start and end lines.
##
## It is recommended to view or edit this file in an application
## providing syntax highlighting, for example, the provided Jupyter
## Lab web app:
## - type 'lab' at the GHSCI prompt
## - navigate the file browser to "process/configuration/region/"
## - double click on a region configuration file ending in ".yml"

This has been done because the point indicators were sampled along the pedestrian network and are therefore unlikely to intersect with buildings.  By taking the average of points within some reasonable distance, the result is like a moving window average that should provide a reasonable representation of the immediate neighbourhood milieu surrounding the building."

## Network analysis related configuration parameters
network:
  #########
  ## Optional network parameters for use in some contexts (eg. island cities)
  ## Whether to only retain main connected network when retrieving OSM roads.
  ## For most settings, set to "false" (the default, used if commented out).
  ## To retain network 'islands' if present, set to "true".
  # osmnx_retain_all: false
  ## Whether to extract the network for the buffered study region.
  ## It is recommended to set to 'true' (the default) in most cases.
  ## Setting this to false may be appropriate for true islands, but could be
  ## problematic for anywhere else where the network and associated amenities
  ## may be accessible beyond the edge of the study region boundary.
  # buffered_region: true
  ## Iterate over and combine polygons
  ## This may be appropriate for a series of islands, like Hong Kong,
  # but in most cases it is recommended to be set as false (the default)
  # polygon_iteration: false
  ## Minimum total network distance for subgraphs to retain.
  ## This is a useful parameter for customising analysis for islands,
  ## like Hong Kong, but for most purposes you can leave this blank (the default).
  # connection_threshold:
  #########
  ## Tolerance in metres for cleaning intersections.
  ## If not providing your own data for evaluating intersection density
  ## (see below), this is an important methodological choice.
  ## The chosen parameter should be robust to a variety of network topologies
  ## in the city being studied. See https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/main/notebooks/04-simplify-graph-consolidate-nodes.ipynb
  intersection_tolerance: 12
  #########
  ## Optionally, data for evaluating intersections can be provided as an
  ## alternative to deriving intersections from OpenStreetMap.
  ## Where such data are available, this may be preferable.
  ## Uncomment and complete the below required fields to use this option.
  ## Custom intersection data settings
  # intersections:

  #   ## a note to describe custom intersection data
  #   note: 'Uncomment this configuration section to optionally specify an external dataset of intersections.  Otherwise, these are derived using OpenStreetMap and OSMnx using the intersection_tolerance parameter.  If providing intersection data, you can modify this note for it to be included in the metadata, or remove it.
