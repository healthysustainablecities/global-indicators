    study_buffer: 1600
    # Study region buffer, to account for edge effects
    chunk_size: 100
    # when doing network analyses, data is processed in chunks
    # By reducing the chunk size (eg 500 instead of 1000) you can avoid memory errors on computers with less memory (eg a laptop with 8Gb ram)
    # Specifically, this can be useful if you notice that the Docker process has been 'Killed' when running the neighbourhood analysis script.

    # Number of processors to use in multiprocessing scripts, if implemented

    # to have localised time estimates for when processes have commenced and finished, modify this (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
